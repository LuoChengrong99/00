## Recovering \( E = mc^2 \) from the Newtonian Limit (Physical Intuition)

Starting from the relativistic energy–momentum relation,
we consider the **low-velocity limit** \( v \ll c \) to recover the classical result.

### Relativistic Momentum

The relativistic momentum is defined as
\[
\mathbf{p} = \gamma m \mathbf{v}, \qquad
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} .
\]

### Relativistic Total Energy

The total relativistic energy is given by
\[
E = \gamma m c^2 .
\]

Expanding the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) for small velocities,
\[
\gamma \approx 1 + \frac{v^2}{2c^2} + \cdots .
\]

Substituting this expansion into the energy expression yields
\[
E \approx mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \cdots .
\]

- The first term represents the **rest energy**.
- The second term corresponds to the **classical kinetic energy**.

This shows that the rest energy \( mc^2 \) naturally emerges as the zero-velocity limit of relativistic energy, ensuring consistency with classical mechanics.
